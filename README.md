I am a software developer with over 3 years of experience in developing enterprise solutions. 
My skills set are in PHP, Laravel, Node.JS, MySQL and React. 
I have worked in both start-up environments as well as some large corporate organizations and this has given me the needed
experience in telling usersâ€™ story and also transforming same into real projects. I love to work in a team but can also work 
in isolation and still deliver good results..
